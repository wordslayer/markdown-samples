# API Calls through Postman For Web
### **Overview**

Postman is a free program that allows you to manage, save, and make API calls for a more streamlined experience. In this tutorial, we will cover how to set up your first API call in Postman using the Constellix DNS API Collection.

----------

## **Common Use Case for Using Postman**

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/what-is-postman/)  is especially helpful for API testing and management and is much less tedious than running curls by hand in a terminal. With this tool, you can analyze APIs created by someone else or test your own.

----------

### **Prerequisites**

-   You already have a  [Postman](https://identity.getpostman.com/login)  account
-   You have created a Workspace in Postman or are using the default workspace (Personal or Team)
-   You have already  [generated API keys](https://support.constellix.com/support/solutions/articles/47001200127-how-to-generate-an-api-key)  in Constellix
